# homework-fullstack

Timebox this homework to 3 hours or less.  KPCC strives to be sensitive to candidatesâ€™ time and effort involved in our interview process, and while we do not expect candidates to spend more than 3 hours on this, we do evaluate submitted solutions on their attention to detail. We will evaluate not only the architecture and implementation of the provided solution, but will
also review tests, read READMEs and code comments, and inspect commits and commit messages. The intention of the code challenge is for us to get a sense of how you normally complete work tasks.

## Guidelines

1. Clone this repo (note: if you *fork* the repo, it will show up as public in your github profile).

1. Do this homework according to specs (below).

1. Update this README in your repo with relevant information specific to your implementation.

1. When you are finished, zip up your project directory and email it back to the interviewer.

## Specs

1. Create a web application that allows the user to search for KPCC articles.  For each article found, display its title and any associated audio files. Note that some articles have related audio content and others do not.  Use the search API [documented here](https://github.com/SCPR/api-docs/blob/master/KPCC/v3/README.md).

1. The search page should look like [this screenshot](search_page.png).  Implement it using HTML and your own SASS/SCSS/CSS. Do not use Bootstrap, Materialize, or any third party style libraries. The results page does not need to match that in design, so feel free to style the results how you would like.

1. The application can be implemented in the language you feel most comfortable in. Front-end javascript is not required, but may be used. Third party dependencies and libraries are allowed, as long as they do not interfere with the style part of the objective in step 2.
